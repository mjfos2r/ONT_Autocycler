Project Status:
- [/] TODO: FIGURE OUT STATUS AND WHAT NEEDS FIXING
- [ ] TODO: Fix cases where reads are too sparse to benefit from subsampling. AKA the single subsample case. (in situations where reads < 1M, do not subsample, treat input reads as entire subsample?)
- [x] TODO: fix dnaapler command from 'chromosome' to 'all' to accomodate multifasta input.
